# openmrs

The one stop CLI for using the OpenMRS 3.0 Microfrontend app.

## Prerequisites

You need Node.js with NPM. We recommend using version 10.18 (LTS) or later.

## Installation

You can run the tool without installation using `npx`, which is part of NPM. Just make sure to fulfill the prerequisites.

Alternatively, install the application globally using `npm i openmrs -g`. Then you can run the tool without `npx`, e.g., instead of `npx openmrs ...` you run `openmrs ...`.

The `--help` flag can also be applied to any command below, resulting in detailed information about the available options.
